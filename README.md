# 📱 Google Play Store Analytics: App Insights Unlocked

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store ecosystem. Using a dataset of over 10,000 apps, the analysis identifies key factors responsible for app success, offering insights into user behavior, pricing strategies, and category performance.

## 📂 Files Description
* **`App Insights Analytics.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations.
* **`googleplaystore.csv`**: The primary dataset with metadata for 10k+ apps (Category, Rating, Size, Installs, etc.).
* **`googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv`**: Supplementary dataset containing sentiment analysis and text reviews.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **High Quality Standard:** The average app rating is **4.19**, indicating a competitive market where quality is expected.
* **Monetization Strategy:** 93% of apps are free. Free apps generate significantly higher user engagement (reviews) compared to paid apps.
* **Category Dynamics:** While **Games** and **Social** apps drive the most downloads, niche categories like **Education** and **Events** often achieve higher user satisfaction ratings.
* **Size vs. Success:** Contrary to common belief, larger app sizes do not significantly hinder download rates.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating static and interactive visualizations.
